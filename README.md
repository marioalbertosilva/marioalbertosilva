Hey! My name is Mário, I have a BSc in Physics and a MSc in Mathematics of Computation. 

At the moment I'm doing a PhD in Computer Science at the Université de Lorraine, in Nancy (FR).

 
I'm interested in what we can do with quantum computers, and how this knowledge relates to fundamental physics.

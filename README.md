Olá! My name is Mário, I have a BSc in Physics and a MSc in Mathematics of Computation. At the moment I'm working in Quantum Key Distribution, specifically in device-independent protocols with classical users.

I'm interested in what we can do with quantum computers, and how this knowledge relates to fundamental physics.
